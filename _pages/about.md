I'm a 3rd year undergraduate at [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) studying Math with a minor in Education and Society. I am part of the [Conceptualization Lab](https://conceptualization.ai/) and [UChicago's Existential Risk Lab](https://xrisk.uchicago.edu/).

My research seeks to further our understanding of how generative models work, their impacts on society in critical domains (e.g. education), and how they can ultimately be developed to augment humanity. I am focusing my research on 1) developing new evaluation frameworks for language models and 2) the interpretability of language models. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to new paradigms in AI in order to make generative systems more transparent, reliable, and effective in benefitting society.

Outside of research, I am a member of [UChicago's track and field team](https://www.instagram.com/uchicagotf/?hl=en) as a high jumper and triple jumper. I also spend some time tutoring math and computer science to middle schoolers and high schoolers.
